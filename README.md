# Disassembler in LegV8

### Usage

I chose to make my script in python, hence why the build.sh script is empty

1. Make sure you can run the shell script by running `chmod +x run.sh`
2. Run the script with `./run.sh <filename>`
3. Dissasembled binary will output to the terminal

#### Example

- There are two test files to test with `test1.asm.machine` and `test2.asm.machine`.
- Run `./run.sh test1.asm.machine` in the terminal
